## Project Status

Welcome to my portfolio and personal information website. In each release, my goal is to make it as eye-catching, lightweight and fast-loading as possible.

## Technologies

This project uses React for front-end design and a simple back-end server utilizing Express. Styling is accomplished with Tailwind CSS and the icon libraries from Font Awesome and Simple Icons. Data for this website is stored in JSON files on the front-end.

## Future Development

Future releases of this website will include a blog section and a contact form.
