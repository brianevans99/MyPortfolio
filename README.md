### Description

This is the repo for my personal website that displays my portfolio, resume and overall information about me. I update my portfolio regularly with new projects as they are completed.

### Technologies

This project uses React for front end design and a simple back end server utilizing Express. Styling is accomplished with Tailwind CSS and the Font Awesome library for icons.
