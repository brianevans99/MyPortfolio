## Project Status

This is about the 3rd re-design of my portfolio site since I've been developing with React. My goal each time is to make my personal website as eye-catching, lightweight and quick-loading as possible.

## Technologies

This project uses React for front-end design and a simple back-end server utilizing Express. Styling is accomplished with Tailwind CSS and the icon libraries from Font Awesome and Simple Icons. Data for this website is stored in JSON files on the front-end.

## Future Development

There are no plans to develop this web application further.
